# Week 4

## Neural network representation

If n (number of features) is too large, classification (and other) problems become too hard too compute!

## Neurons and the brain

Algorithms that try to mimic the brain. The brain may have a "one learning algorithm" that can learn/adapt to basically anything (quantum?)
